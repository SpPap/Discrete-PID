# PID
Here is an implementation of a discrete PID in MATLAB


For the integral term, 2 methods are being used for numerical
integration (Trapezoidal rule and Composite Simpson's 1/3 rule). We have 
an advanced integral term handling based on whether k is even or odd.

The derivative term is implemented using backward Euler.
